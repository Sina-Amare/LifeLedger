Hi {{ user.username }},

You're receiving this email because you requested a password reset for your LifeLedger account.

Please go to the following page and choose a new password:
{{ protocol }}://{{ domain }}{% url 'accounts:password_reset_confirm' uidb64=uid token=token %}

If you didn't request a password reset, you can safely ignore this email.

Thank you,
The LifeLedger Team
